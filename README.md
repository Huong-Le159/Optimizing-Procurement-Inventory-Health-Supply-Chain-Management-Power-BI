## 📌 Background & Overview

**Objective:**
To reduce operational risk by optimizing vendor reliability, balancing inventory levels, and analyzing procurement spend efficiency.

### 📖 What is this project about?
This project focuses on designing a Power BI analytics dashboard using the **AdventureWorks** dataset, utilizing data from Purchasing, Inventory, Vendors, and Product tables.

The goal is to equip the supply chain and procurement teams with clear, actionable insights to:
*   Analyze **$64M** in total purchase spend and identify cost variance trends.
*   Monitor vendor performance to distinguish between high-reliability partners and risk-prone suppliers.
*   Visualize inventory health to solve the "Stockout vs. Overstock" imbalance.
*   Enable data-driven decisions for reorder points and vendor contract negotiations.

### 👤 Who is this project for?
*   **Procurement Managers** needing to evaluate vendor compliance and negotiate better terms.
*   **Supply Chain Directors** responsible for minimizing backorders and optimizing cash flow.
*   **Inventory Analysts** looking to identify slow-moving stock and adjust safety stock levels.
*   **Operations Leads** requiring real-time visibility into fulfillment rates and lead times.

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations

### 🔍 Dashboard Preview

### 📋 I. Overview

<img width="1752" height="977" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd9f6ff6-1693-44e7-b7ab-d0c47bbed1fd" />

<details>
<summary> <strong>⭐ Key Findings — Overview</strong></summary>

#### 🚨 1. Critical Data Anomaly: Q4 Purchasing Stop
*   **Observation:** The "Monthly Cumulative Purchase Spend" chart shows the Current Year (Blue line) climbing steadily to **$64M** by September, then **completely flatlining** for the rest of the year.
*   **Implication:** Unlike the previous year (Green area) which showed continued growth, this indicates either a total freeze on purchasing in Q4 or **missing data** for October, November, and December in the ERP system.

#### ⚠️ 2. Data Quality Alert: $22M Unclassified Spend
*   **Observation:** In the "Purchase Spend by Product Subcategory" chart, the largest bar is **"(Blank)"**, accounting for **$22M** (approx. 34% of total spend).
*   **Implication:** Over one-third of procurement costs are not mapped to a specific product category. This requires immediate data remediation to accurately track category performance.

#### 📉 3. Operational Health: Persistent Backorders
*   **Observation:** The overall **Backorder Rate is 9.42%**. The monthly trend shows this is not a seasonal spike but a consistent issue, fluctuating between **8.5% and 10.5%** year-round.
*   **Implication:** Nearly 1 in 10 orders faces a stock shortage, suggesting a systemic issue with inventory planning calculations or vendor fulfillment capabilities.

#### 💰 4. Vendor Concentration Risk
*   **Observation:** **Superior Bicycles** is the dominant vendor with **$4.6M** in spend, significantly higher than the next largest vendors (Professional Athletic Consultants at $3.1M).
*   **Implication:** The supply chain is heavily reliant on a single partner. Performance issues with Superior Bicycles (high backorder rates noted in other views) will disproportionately impact the entire company.

#### ✅ 5. The Fulfillment vs. Availability Paradox
*   **Observation:** The dashboard reports a **99.92% On-Time Fulfillment Rate** despite the **9.42% Backorder Rate**.
*   **Implication:** This indicates a potential conflict in KPI definitions. Vendors may be shipping "what they have" on time (high fulfillment score) but failing to ship the "complete order" (high backorder score).

> **💡 Managerial Takeaway:** While total spend is substantial ($64M), the "Blank" data category obscures $22M of insights. Immediate focus must be placed on classifying this data and investigating why purchasing data stops in Q4.

### 📈 II. Product Analysis

<img width="1741" height="980" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bfcc548-6698-4d5a-b168-182dbf5d039e" />

<details>
<summary> <strong>⭐ Key Findings — Overview</strong></summary>
  
#### ⚠️ 1. Portfolio Health Risk
*   **Observation:** **373 out of 504 products (74%)** are classified as "At-Risk."
*   **Implication:** The majority of the product catalog requires intervention, indicating a systemic failure in automated reordering logic.

#### 📉 2. The "High-Value" Stockout
*   **Observation:** **HL Mountain Frames** are the #1 product by spend ($1.13M) but also the #1 product by **Stock Shortfall (145 units)**.
*   **Implication:** The company is stocking out of its best-sellers/highest investment items, directly damaging revenue and ROI.

#### 🛑 3. Capital Misalignment (The "Long Tail" Problem)
*   **Observation:** While critical components are backordered (15.79% rate), the "Inventory Status" table flags low-value items (Ball Bearings, Caps, Bike Stands) as severely **Overstocked**.
*   **Implication:** Cash flow is tied up in slow-moving, low-value inventory. The dashboard explicitly recommends **"Pause Purchasing"** for these items.

> **💡 Managerial Takeaway:** Stop buying "Bike Stands" and "Bearings" immediately. Redirect that capital to solve the shortage of "HL Mountain Frames."

### III. 🤝 Vendor Performance

<img width="1735" height="972" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5777218b-d3e5-47a4-a640-d759062fd2e4" />

<details>
<summary> <strong>⭐ Key Findings — Overview</strong></summary>

#### 🚨 1. The "High-Spend" Reliability Crisis
*   **Observation:** The top vendors by spend are the worst performers. **First Rate Bicycles** ($2.1M) and **Chicago City Saddles** ($3.0M) have backorder rates exceeding **21%**.
*   **Implication:** We are heavily investing in partners who fail to deliver 1 in 5 times. Contract renegotiations should prioritize "On-Time In-Full" (OTIF) penalties over price breaks.

#### 🛡️ 2. Strong Financial Vetting
*   **Observation:** The "Spend vs Credit Rating" scatter plot confirms that high-spend vendors (large bubbles) consistently have top-tier Credit Ratings (1).
*   **Implication:** Financial risk is well-managed. The supply chain is stable financially but unstable operationally.

#### ⚠️ 3. The "Static Lead Time" Blind Spot
*   **Observation:** The detail table shows an identical **Lead Time of 9 days** for almost every major vendor.
*   **Implication:** This indicates a data quality issue where "Standard Lead Time" is being used instead of "Actual Lead Time." Without accurate lead time data, safety stock calculations will fail, leading to the stockouts observed in the Product Analysis.

> **💡 Managerial Takeaway:** Initiate a Business Review with **Superior Bicycles** and **Chicago City Saddles**. Demand a reduction in Backorder Rate from ~20% to <5% as a condition for retaining the $7.6M combined spend.
